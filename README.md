# FriendlyDagger

Let's see how we can set up Dagger, what are the different configurations we can choose from and what will each offer. I wanted a sandbox to help myself and hopefully others. Please let me know if I can improve something or add an additional setup :) thank you for checking this out!

## 01_Basic

The most basic dagger configuration comprising of just an application graph that provides a retrofit service.

Check out the [DI Package](../master/01_Basic/app/src/main/java/friendlyrobot/nyc/friendlydagger/basic/di). There you will see the [Application Component](../master/01_Basic/app/src/main/java/friendlyrobot/nyc/friendlydagger/basic/di/ApplicationComponent.kt) and the [Application Module](../master/01_Basic/app/src/main/java/friendlyrobot/nyc/friendlydagger/basic/di/ApplicationModule.kt)
